<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is NNABURU CHIDUMEBI BENEDICT popularly known as "Dumzy". I'm a web developer and a financial market analyst. I'm a student of the UNIVERSITY OF BENIN and i am in my penultimate year, about rounding
  up the semester. Currently, i'm in the department of ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND TOXICOLOGY and basically,
  i've gotten to understand things about the environment especially in the aspect of it's management, sustainability
  and productivity.

  Well, let me tell you different things about me. I love listening to good music, love travelling/going on adventures,
  looking forward to trying out skydiving "lol". I don't really have a favourite sport though quite weird right?
  i just feel like we all have our preferences and what actually interest us. I can be quite strict & playful at times 
  maybe because i'm the eldest sibling in my home so we just have lots of principles to lay down for our 
  younger ones to follow. I'm attracted to knowledge, i.e i love finding out new things whether being told or 
  self discoveries.
